## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding Netflix Clone. 

In this project, I will create a netflix clone Application. I' m going to use React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase and Styled Components. I have built pages sign in , sign up and browse the homepage. I used protected routes with auth listeners, Firebase firestore for handling all the data.

I handled styling via styled components. 

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
